# The five patterns

How Jev calls get composed into something useful. From TypeSafe's own docs
([fan-out](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/fan-out),
[confidence routing](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/confidence-routing),
[intent routing](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/intent-routing),
[composite scoring](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/composite-scoring)), worked through with the
`jev` command, and fuzzy rules over the answers with `-r`.

They compose: intent routing is usually fan-out plus confidence routing, and a ranking step is
composite scoring over one fan-out call.

## Fan-out

**Ask everything you might need in one call, including questions whose relevance depends on the
answer to another. Let your code decide what mattered.**

Questions are answered in parallel, so a call with six questions costs barely more time than one
with two — only tokens. Branching *after* the call beats a round trip per branch.

```json
{
  "category":     {"type": "choice", "instructions": "What kind of ticket is this?",
                   "criteria": {"bug": "something is broken", "billing": "a charge or invoice",
                                "feature": "asking for something that doesn't exist", "account": "access or settings"}},
  "severity":     {"type": "score",  "instructions": "If this is a bug, how bad is it?",
                   "criteria": ["cosmetic", "annoying", "blocking work"]},
  "has_repro":    {"type": "noul",   "instructions": "Did they give steps to reproduce it?"},
  "wants_refund": {"type": "noul",   "instructions": "Are they asking for money back?"},
  "frustration":  {"type": "score",  "instructions": "How frustrated does the writer sound?",
                   "criteria": ["calm", "irritated", "very angry"]}
}
```

```sh
jev -f ticket.txt -q triage.json --json > reply.json

case "$(jq -r '.answers.category.choice' reply.json)" in
  bug)     jq -r '"severity \(.answers.severity.score), repro \(.answers.has_repro.noul)"' reply.json ;;
  billing) jq -r '"refund wanted: \(.answers.wants_refund.noul > 0.5)"' reply.json ;;
  feature) echo "backlog" ;;                       # severity and repro were asked and ignored
esac
jq -r '"frustration \(.answers.frustration.score)"' reply.json   # applies whatever the category
```

**Avoid it** when the branches are genuinely sequential (the second question can't be written until
the first is answered), when a truly single question will do, or when the wasted tokens actually
matter to you.

## Confidence routing

**The answer tells you what; confidence tells you whether to act on it.** Pick a threshold per
action, scaled to what that action costs if it's wrong.

TypeSafe's rough bands: act autonomously above ~0.85 for anything consequential, ask the user to
confirm between ~0.6 and ~0.85, and escalate to a person below ~0.6. These are starting points —
what a low confidence *means* depends on your stakes, so tune them against real traffic.

```sh
jev -f message.txt -q intent.json --json > reply.json
intent=$(jq -r '.answers.intent.choice' reply.json)
sure=$(jq -r '.answers.intent.confidence' reply.json)

if   awk "BEGIN{exit !($sure < 0.6)}";  then handoff_to_a_person
elif [ "$intent" = check_balance ];     then show_balance            # low stakes, 0.6 is plenty
elif [ "$intent" = approve_transfer ]; then
       awk "BEGIN{exit !($sure > 0.85)}" && approve || confirm_with_user
fi
```

A Noul carries no separate confidence — its probability *is* the confidence, so gate on the
probability itself and treat the middle band (say 0.3–0.7) as "unsure".

**Avoid it** when every decision warrants the same threshold, or when there's no fallback to fall
back to: a gate with nowhere to escalate just stalls.

## Intent routing

**Classify cheaply first, then hand off.** One small call decides which handler gets the request —
deterministic code, a specialist model, or a person — instead of sending everything through the
expensive path.

A Choice for the category, plus a Score for how hard it looks, covers most of it:

```json
{
  "intent":     {"type": "choice", "instructions": "What does the customer want? Route by what they're asking you to do.",
                 "criteria": {"order_status": "where is my order", "product_question": "how does it work",
                              "return_exchange": "sending it back", "complaint": "unhappy, wants it made right",
                              "other": "none of these"}},
  "complexity": {"type": "score",  "instructions": "How much work is answering this?",
                 "criteria": ["a lookup", "needs judgment", "needs an exception or a manager"]}
}
```

Route on the intent, then let complexity override: a `product_question` scoring at the top level
goes to a person even though its category has a cheap handler. Confidence first, as above — a
misrouted request costs more than the model call you saved.

**Avoid it** when every request ends up at the same handler anyway, when the routing is a single
branch, or when a misroute is unrecoverable and accuracy has to be near-perfect.

## Composite scoring

**Score independent dimensions separately, then combine them yourself.** One "how good is this
overall?" question hides its reasoning and can't be retuned. Several narrow ones stay legible, and
the weights become a dial you can turn without touching the criteria.

Ask them in one call (this is fan-out again):

```json
{
  "depth":      {"type": "score", "instructions": "How deep is the candidate's Python experience?",
                 "criteria": ["none", "scripts", "production services", "libraries others depend on", "language internals"]},
  "leadership": {"type": "score", "instructions": "How much have they led other engineers?",
                 "criteria": ["none", "mentored one", "led a project", "led a team", "led an org"]}
}
```

Normalize each to 0–1 by dividing by its top level, then weight and sum:

```sh
jev -f cv.txt -q dimensions.json --json \
  | jq -r '(.answers.depth.score / 4) as $d | (.answers.leadership.score / 4) as $l
           | "ic \(0.8 * $d + 0.2 * $l | .*100 | round / 100)  lead \(0.3 * $d + 0.7 * $l | .*100 | round / 100)"'
```

Two roles, two weightings, one call. The top level is `(levels - 1)`, since levels are numbered from
0 — with five levels, divide by 4.

**Avoid it** when two dimensions measure the same thing (adding both counts it twice), or when the
judgment is genuinely holistic and the weights would be invented.

## Fuzzy rules

**Let Jev read the situation and let rules, written by whoever owns the decision, say what to do.**
A rules file reads Jev's probabilities (a Noul's, a Score level's, a Choice option's) as the
degrees to which its terms hold, combines them, and gives each outcome a **support score**. That
reading is a modelling choice: a score says how strongly the policy supports an outcome, not how
likely it is, so don't pass it on as a probability. The answers keep the probabilities.

Ask the inputs as Scores with named levels, 3–5 each: `Cold|Mild|Hot`, not a number. Graded ideas
belong in a Score; keep Nouls for things that are true or false.

```json
{"temp":     {"type": "score", "instructions": "How warm is it outside? Cold is under 10 °C, Mild 10 to 22 °C, Hot over 22 °C.", "criteria": ["Cold", "Mild", "Hot"]},
 "humidity": {"type": "score", "instructions": "How humid is the air? Dry is under 40% relative humidity, Normal 40 to 70%, Humid over 70%.", "criteria": ["Dry", "Normal", "Humid"]},
 "raining":  {"type": "noul",  "instructions": "Is it raining, or about to?"}}
```

```toml
[logic]                  # optional
and = "min"              # min (default: the weakest condition decides) | product | lukasiewicz
or  = "max"              # max (default: the strongest reason decides) | probsum | bounded

[decide]
threshold = 0.5          # an item is a yes at or over this

[terms]
cold = "temp.Cold"
mild = "temp.Mild"
hot = "temp.Hot"
humid = "humidity.Humid"
raining = "raining"

[[rule]]
if = "cold"
then = "coat"

[[rule]]
if = "mild AND NOT raining"
then = "light jacket"

[[rule]]
if = "raining AND NOT hot"
then = "raincoat"

[[rule]]
if = "hot"
then = "t-shirt"
```

```sh
jev -f weather.txt -q weather.json -r wear.toml --table
```

Designing them:

1. **One rule per piece of know-how**, in the owner's words: "a raincoat when it rains, unless it's
   hot" is `raining AND NOT hot`.
2. **Check coverage.** Walk every combination of levels (cold/mild/hot × raining or not) and make sure
   some rule speaks for each; a gap means no outcome in that weather.
3. **Look for conflicts** — two rules saying opposite things for one situation — and decide which
   wins, or make a third outcome.
4. **Tune with real states.** Run ten or twenty through `-r` to debug the rules — that is
   exploration, not evidence that they work — and fix a rule, a weight or the threshold, never the
   answers. Before relying on them, check them against a set of reviewed cases they weren't tuned on. `--table` shows which rule gave each score, and `--graph` (or
   `--svg rules.svg`) draws every rule with its numbers.

Operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, parentheses, and hedges `VERY` (a²), `SOMEWHAT` (√a), `EXTREMELY`
(a³), `INDEED` (pushed toward 0 or 1). Hedges and `NOT` bind tightest, then `AND`, then `OR`. Use
`probsum` for OR when distinct reasons should reinforce each other (it counts a reason written twice
twice), and `bounded` to add up levels or options of one question, which exclude each other: the
chance of "Today or This week" is their sum. Hedges only reshape a score: `VERY angry` passes 0.5
when `P(Angry)` is 0.71 or more, and it can't tell angry from furious — ask a level for that. None of
the operators gives the probability of a compound event.

Nothing is exclusive unless a rule makes it so: at `raining` 0.5, both `raining` and `NOT raining`
score 0.5 and pass a 0.5 threshold. When two outcomes can't both happen, write what picks between
them, and send a case near the threshold to a person.

### Outputs: an amount, not a yes

When the decision is an amount (how long to water, how many minutes to wait), declare an output: a
crisp axis with named fuzzy sets. Rules conclude `OUTPUT IS SET`, and `X IS Y` always names an
output, so a typo is an error. A set's rules are joined by OR into its score, the set is clipped at
that score, the clipped sets are merged with OR, and the value is the centre of the merged shape
(Mamdani inference, centroid defuzzification).

```toml
[output.irrigation]            # minutes of watering: say the unit, the file has none
range  = [0, 100]
short  = [0, 0, 20, 40]       # trapezoid: a, b, c, d
medium = [30, 50, 70]         # triangle: a, peak, c
long   = [60, 80, 100, 100]

[[rule]]
if = "scarce"
then = "irrigation IS long"

[[rule]]
if = "regular"
then = "irrigation IS medium"
```

Whether neighbouring sets overlap is your policy's choice: overlapping ones let support for two
sets give a value between them. (A Score's levels don't overlap: they exclude each other, even when
several have some probability.) The value says where the support is, not how much: a set clipped
at 0.01 alone gives nearly the same value as one at 1 (exactly the same for a symmetric set), so
check the sets' scores before acting on it. And two supported sets far apart give a value between
them that neither supports; if that compromise is wrong, make the rules choose. Keep hard limits in
code.

**Avoid it** when one answer decides alone (read it directly), or when you'd be inventing rules
nobody holds: then a weighted sum is at least honest about being a guess.
